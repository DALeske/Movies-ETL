# Module 8 Challenge: Movies-ETL

## Purpose:
Amazing Prime has requested an automated data pipeline to clean their video data on a daily basis. The purpose of this analysis is to provide a data pipeline to combine and clean data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens, and upload the cleaned data to a data server. The ETL process provided will allow Amazing Prime to have the most up-to-date movie information and ratings for the movie services they provide.
